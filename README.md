# Image Processing

This is an experiment in parameterizing objects in images.  A goal here is to use the parameterization in an image recognition technique that is scale, shift and rotation invariant.  A work in progress.

# Installation

```bash
pipenv install snovalleyai-image-processing
```

# Loading

```bash
from snovalleyai_image_processing.Derivative import *
```
