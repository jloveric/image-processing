# Image Processing

This is an experiment in using TVD (Total Variation Diminishing) derivatives (a technique used in computational fluid dynamics) as a basis for some simple image processing.  A goal here is to parametrize objects in an image and then use those to create a much better image recognition technique.  A work in progress.
